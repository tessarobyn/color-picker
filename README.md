JavaScript color picker designed to make it easy to add a color picker to your website.

For feature docs and help, go to the project's site [here](https://tessarobyn.github.io/color-picker/)

Recommended minimum dimensions for the color picker = 200px x 400px

## Setup

Please note if you are running this locally, you need to run your website on a server otherwise the color picker won't work.

1. First, you need to download the folder 'colorPickerScripts' from this repository and put it in the same folder as your website pages.
2. Add `<div class="colorPicker" style="width: 250px; height: 450px"></div>` to your html file and adjust the width and height according to your requirements. (Recommended minimum dimensions for the color picker = 200px x 400px)
3. Add a link to the main color picker script in your page with this line of code: `<script type="module" src="colorPickerScripts/colorPickerScript.js"></script>`.
   Make sure it is near the bottom of the file, under the div you have added for the color picker.
4. Run your website (on a server) and your color picker should appear!

## Features
